# Fibber
 The Fibbonacci sequence is a simple numeric sequence that comes up
 frequently in Computer Science and design tasks.
 Let 's write a generator that can tell us an arbitrary quantity
 of numbers in the sequence.

going to build code that takes in a quantity (a number of outputs)
and goes through the generator to create x outputs using the counter
works by:
start with 0 and 1 (array? you can use position?)
 then add position [0] + [1]
